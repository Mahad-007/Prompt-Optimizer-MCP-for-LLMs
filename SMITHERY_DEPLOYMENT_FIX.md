# 🔧 Fixing Smithery Deployment Issue

## 🚨 **Current Issue**
Your Smithery deployment is showing "Something went wrong" because the build process failed. The error indicates that Smithery doesn't have a proper loader configured for Python files.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The issue is that Smithery's CLI is trying to build Python files directly, but it needs a different approach for Python MCP servers.

## ✅ **Solution Steps**

### **Option 1: Use Smithery Web Interface (Recommended)**

1. **Go to Smithery Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://smithery.ai/dashboard
   - Click "Deploy Server"

2. **Upload Your Code**
   - Create a ZIP file of your project (excluding unnecessary files)
   - Upload the ZIP file to Smithery

3. **Configure Deployment**
   - Set runtime to: `Python 3.11`
   - Set entry point to: `server.py`
   - Add environment variable: `PYTHONPATH=.`

### **Option 2: Fix Local Deployment**

1. **Create a proper build script:**
   ```bash
   # Create a build script
   echo '#!/bin/bash
   echo "Building MCP server..."
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python -c "from tools.optimize import optimize_prompt; print(\"Build successful\")"
   ' > build.sh
   chmod +x build.sh
   ```

2. **Update smithery.json:**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "prompt-optimizer-mcp",
     "description": "A Model Context Protocol server for optimizing and scoring LLM prompts",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "runtime": "python",
     "entrypoint": "server.py",
     "buildCommand": "./build.sh",
     "dependencies": {
       "mcp-server-fastmcp": ">=0.1.0"
     },
     "environment": {
       "PYTHONPATH": "."
     }
   }
   ```

### **Option 3: Use Docker Deployment**

1. **Build Docker image locally:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t prompt-optimizer-mcp .
   ```

2. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   docker run --rm prompt-optimizer-mcp python -c "from tools.optimize import optimize_prompt; print('Test passed')"
   ```

3. **Push to container registry and deploy**

## 🛠️ **Immediate Fix**

### **Step 1: Clean up current deployment**
```bash
# Remove the failed deployment
# (This will be done through the Smithery web interface)
```

### **Step 2: Prepare for redeployment**
```bash
# Test your server locally
python server.py

# In another terminal, test the MCP connection
# (Use an MCP client to connect to your local server)
```

### **Step 3: Redeploy using web interface**
1. Go to https://smithery.ai/dashboard
2. Click "Deploy Server"
3. Upload your project files
4. Configure as Python runtime
5. Set entry point to `server.py`

## 🔧 **Alternative: Use Different MCP Hosting**

If Smithery continues to have issues, consider:

1. **Railway**: https://railway.app
2. **Render**: https://render.com
3. **Fly.io**: https://fly.io
4. **Heroku**: https://heroku.com

## 📋 **Checklist for Successful Deployment**

- [ ] Server runs locally without errors
- [ ] All dependencies are in requirements.txt
- [ ] Entry point (server.py) is correct
- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] Python version is compatible (3.11+)
- [ ] MCP server responds to basic commands

## 🆘 **If Still Having Issues**

1. **Check Smithery Status**: https://status.smithery.ai
2. **Join Smithery Discord**: https://discord.gg/smithery
3. **Create GitHub Issue**: Report the deployment problem
4. **Use Alternative Hosting**: Consider other platforms

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After successful deployment, you should see:
- ✅ Green status in Smithery dashboard
- ✅ "Connect" section working properly
- ✅ MCP server responding to commands
- ✅ Tools available for inspection

**Next Steps:**
1. Try the web interface deployment first
2. If that fails, use alternative hosting
3. Test your MCP server thoroughly before deployment
